          I am a software developer with a strong foundation in IT, networking, and technical support. I started my career as a
          In Store Network Specialist Temp with Kroger, before moving on to Brightview Health where my current title is Computer
          Support Specialist II. In both positions I was rapidly promoted to Tier 2 support due to my strong ability to 
          troubleshoot complex issues, improve workflows and communicate technical issues to people across the technical 
          knowledge spectrum. My experience in networking, infrastructure, and user support grew within me a deep understanding 
          of system architecture and problem solving - skills I now apply to software development.

          Besides technology I do a lot of work with a local mutual aid organization, helping to coordinate logistics and resource
          sharing efforts. Working in these spaces has strengthened my ability to analyze complex systems, collaborate across
          different skill sets, and adapt quickly to changing needs. These experiences shape how I approach development - focusing
          on effciency, accessibility, and real-world impact. I am also involved with several other community organizations such as
          Second Unitarian Church of Chicago, and run a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game with my friends.

          Lately, Iâ€™ve been developing SmartDesk, an application that emphasizes GUI development with Kivy, network programming, 
          and database management. This project has been a deep dive into creating intuitive user interfaces, handling real-time 
          communication between devices, and optimizing data storage for efficiency. I'm always looking for ways to refine my 
          skills and explore how technology can improve both workflow automation and accessibility, and make a positive impact on
          people's lives.
